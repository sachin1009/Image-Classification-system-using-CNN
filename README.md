# Image Classification using CNNs

Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images accurately. This project utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, containing 60,000 labeled images from 10 categories.

## Features

- Python codebase with TensorFlow and Keras
- Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation modules
- Achieve high accuracy in image classification
- Customizable for specific needs

## Usage

1. Install Python 3, TensorFlow, and Keras.
2. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset (link provided).
3. Preprocess the data and split into training and test sets.
4. Train the CNN model on the training set.
5. Evaluate the trained model on the test set.
6. Customize the codebase for your image classification tasks.

## Results

After training and evaluation, the model achieves high accuracy in classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge the CIFAR-10 dataset creators for providing a benchmark for image classification tasks.

Feel free to explore and customize this codebase for your specific image classification needs. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out.
